                <p class="p1">I  grew up in Houston, Texas. I have two amazing sisters, one is 21 and the other is 20. We are incredibly close and my sisters and parents are my best friends. Not weird my parents are really cool. When I graduated High School I decided to move to Nashville, to attend Lipscomb University. I graduated Lipscomb with a Bachelors of Science in Psychology. My favorite college memory is when I lived abroad in London. That was the best few months of my life, to date. I love food, if I had a last meal it would be a medium filet mignon, baked potatoe and garlic breadsticks. If I could do anything and money wasnt an issue I would travek the world and writing about everything I do, eat, see and everyone I meet. My favorite show is The Office, it got me through all the transitional periods of my life. I also find joy in Parks and Rec. I recenetly started watching and am obsessed with Friends. I enjoy movies like Lord of The Rings, Star Wars, Harry Potter and many others that I basically get transported to another world. I enjoy all things cozy, which is probably why the months of Halloween through December is my favorite time of year. I am basically a 12 year old trapped inside a 22 year old and proud of it!</p>
